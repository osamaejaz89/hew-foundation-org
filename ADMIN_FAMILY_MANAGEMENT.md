## Customization

### Styling
The components use Material-UI theming. To customize:
1. Modify the theme in `src/styles/`
2. Update component styling using `sx` prop
3. Override Material-UI component styles

### Adding New Features
1. Extend the TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/family.ts`
2. Add new API methods in `src/services/familyService.ts`
3. Update the custom hook in `src/hooks/useFamilyAdmin.ts`
4. Create new components or extend existing ones

### API Integration
To integrate with different APIs:
1. Update the base URL in `src/services/apiClient.ts`
2. Modify API endpoints in `src/services/familyService.ts`
3. Update TypeScript interfaces to match API response structure

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:
- API error responses are caught and displayed as toast notifications
- Loading states are managed for better UX
- Form validation prevents invalid data submission
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations

## Performance Considerations

- Pagination is implemented for large datasets
- Search debouncing prevents excessive API calls
- Lazy loading for charts and heavy components
- Optimized re-renders using React hooks

## Security

- All admin operations require authentication
- Protected routes ensure only authorized access
- API calls include authorization headers
- Input validation prevents malicious data

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the system:
- Real-time updates using WebSocket
- Advanced filtering and sorting options
- Batch import functionality
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Mobile-responsive design improvements
- Multi-language support
- Audit logging for admin actions

## Support

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify API connectivity and authentication
3. Review the TypeScript interfaces for data structure
4. Consult the API documentation for endpoint details
